                    <h1>A Furious Sky over Mount Shasta</h1>
                    <p>Is the sky angry with Mount Shasta? According to 
                        some ancient legends, the spirits of above and 
                        below worlds fight there, sometimes quite actively 
                        during eruptions of this enormous volcano in 
                        California, USA. Such drama can well be imagined in 
                        this deep sky image taken in late June. Evident above
                        the snow-covered peak is the central band of our
                        Milky Way Galaxy, on the left, and a picturesque 
                        sky toward the modern constellations of Scorpius 
                        and Ophiuchus, above and to the right. The bright 
                        orange star Antares and the colorful rho Ophiuchi 
                        cloud complex are visible just to the right of Mount
                        Shasta, while the red emission nebula surrounding 
                        the star zeta Ophiuchi appears on the top right. 
                        The static earth image in the featured composite 
                        was taken during the blue hour, while a two-panel 
                        panorama tracking the background sky was taken 
                        later that night with the same camera and from 
                        the same location. Within a few million years, 
                        Antares, some stars in the rho Ophiuchi system, 
                        and zeta Ophiuchi will all likely explode as 
                        supernovas.
