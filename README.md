Project: Astronomy Picture of the Day Search

Design Desicions
 - I prefered a dark background concept to have a feeling of the space for the astronomy pictures.
 - I have a minimal, plain design to let user focus on the pictures and the information on the website.
 - There are three main screens the user will see, the firs one is the landing screen where user needs to log in and enter a date.
 - Next, the astronomy picture of the date will show up on the page with the explanation. The little heart icon at the right bottom will let user to add the picture to their favorites. 
 - If user wants to see their favorite pictures, they will click on the favorites link on the left menu.
 - Clicking the heart for the second time will delete the picture from the favorites.


 Part-3 Steps and Challanges
 - I made the login page first. The hardest part was putting the background image in a position that I wanted. I had to decide if it's better to put the img in html or css.
 - I made the content section with the nav bar for user to see the content they asked for. Then on another pop up screen I made the favorites section for user to stock the images they choose.
 - I have never done a vertical navigation before, so I had to look it up from youtube to have an idea about how to achieve it.
 - Since I don't how much of an idea about how to use Javascript in my website for now, I had to make everything static. I may need to change some html later to add a dynamic Javascript instead.
