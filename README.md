Project: Astronomy Picture of the Day Search

Design Desicions
 - I prefered a dark background concept to have a feeling of the space for the astronomy pictures.
 - I have a minimal, plain design to let user focus on the pictures and the information on the website.
 - There are three main screens the user will see, the firs one is the landing screen where user needs to log in and enter a date.
 - Next, the astronomy picture of the date will show up on the page with the explanation. The little heart icon at the right bottom will let user to add the picture to their favorites. 
 - If user wants to see their favorite pictures, they will click on the favorites link on the left menu.
 - Clicking the heart for the second time will delete the picture from the favorites.
